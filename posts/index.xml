      <description>This is a rough guide to which setting to use on the Urbanic 070s grinder for a few different brewing methods, and some recipes I like using with them.
I&amp;rsquo;ve modded my grinder to be stepless, and set the dial such that it just chirps when the pointer goes below (clockwise from) zero. This is covered in this video from Lance Hedrick.
Recipes are in format: {Recipe} - {creator&amp;rsquo;s grind description} - {good starting setting}</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen ChatGPT everywhere at the moment so wanted to play around with the OpenAI API and see if I could come up with something useful (to me). I sometimes write up recipes for myself or friends, but have stopped largely due to laziness in making them properly readable. I wrote some code to flesh out the skeleton of a recipe into a fully-formed, readable recipe, and intend to use this regularly.</description>
